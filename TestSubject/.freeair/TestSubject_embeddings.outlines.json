If the provided instance is null, it throws an ArgumentNullException.\r\n\r\nThe SearchFor method is used to search for voyages that match the given date and conditions. It takes a Voyage instance and a DateTime as arguments. It retrieves all the voyages on the provided date from the repository, removes the first voyage from the list (to exclude the same voyage as the provided one), and then finds all voyages that have the first station of their route equal to the last station of the first voyage\u0027s route. Finally, it returns the list of these allowed voyages."

This class is primarily used for comparison of lists or arrays of objects for equality, based on the implementation of the IEquatable interface in the generic type T.\r\n\r\nIt provides a static method named IsCollectionEquals that accepts two parameters of type IReadOnlyList\u003CT\u003E. The method performs a series of checks to see if the two collections are the same instance, if either one of them is null, or if their element counts are not equal. If any of these conditions are met, it returns false. If the collections are not the same instance and have the same element counts, the method iterates over the collections, comparing each pair of elements. If all elements are equal, the method returns true. If any pair of elements are not equal, the method returns false.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this helper class is to provide a more concise and readable way to compare collections for equality, especially useful in situations where you need to compare collections of complex types."
