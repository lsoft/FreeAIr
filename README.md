FreeAIr is a Visual Studio extension which allows you to interact with LLM without barriers.

Wait, another one?! Yes, yet another LLM VSIX :)

Why? There is a fantastic Copilot! Because Copilot is a subject of politics. Today you are enjoying Copilot, tomorrow you country has been banned from it.

FreeAIr is not a political subject and provides no artificial barriers.
